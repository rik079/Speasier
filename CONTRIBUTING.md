# Contributing guidelines

Hey! If you're part of Speasy but not actually working on the project, don't feel scared if GitHub wants you to read this when submitting an issue. You can ignore it! :D

I'd like to keep this all a bit informal, but there are some things to keep in mind to keep it all a bit structured:

## Communication and coordination

Coordination for the project is done on #coders-and-bott-butts on Discord. 

## Branch naming conventions

Branches with new features or improvements are to be named `feature/speasier-{IssueID}`. For bugfixes, `fix/speasier-{IssueID}`

## Pull requests

When submitting a PR, please put `resolves #{IssueID}` somewhere in the description, to make sure the issue and PR are linked and the issue automatically closes once the PR is merged.

## Issues

When you're submitting an issue as a contributing member, feel free to completely ignore the issue template and submit stuff the way you like, it was put there to make it easier for people to help us out. Please leave the title tag intact.

## CHANGING THIS DOCUMENT

If you want to add or change stuff, please commit your version of it to a seperate branch, submit a pull request, and add all active contributors as a reviewer so we can have a look at it.
