# Speasier

Here we are building our very own text to speach discord bot.

## What can it do

- Currently, not much.
### Once we are done
- It will be able to join your voice channel and speak for you. 
- You will be able to select a voice for yourself and once registered only you can use it.
- A system admin can set the channel it will listen too so you won't need to use a prefix for speaking.
